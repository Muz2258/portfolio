            <h1>Woklyn: a decision to go digtal</h1>
            <hr>
            <h3 slot="h-1">Summary</h3>
            <p>Woklyn’s request was to design a mobile app that will facilitate their transition into becoming a digital laundry service provider. Which seemed like the best of moves at the time. However, after some time of research, it turned out that they needed to redesign the internal process of their service to enhance customer trust and satisfaction before looking back into going digital.</p>

            <h2 slot="h-2">About Woklyn</h2>
            <p>Woklyn is a small laundry service provider within the city of Port harcourt, Nigeria. The business is a little over a year old. The business is founded on the principles of customer satisfaction and excellent service delivery at the cheapest possible rate.</p>

            <h2 slot="h-3">The request</h2>
            <p>“We are looking to scale our business. But in the most cost effective way. And we believe that going digital is the way to go.” so they said to me. Sounds really interesting I guess. However, my primary goal for any project is to ensure that I help my clients achieve their goals by helping them tackle the right problems. With this in mind, I discussed my process (A mixture of Human Centered Design (HCD) and Double Diamond) with them, and I was given the go ahead to kick off.</p>

            <h2 slot="h-3">The process</h2>
            <h3 slot="sh-3-1">Client interview</h3>
            <p>My first line of action when faced with clients like Woklyn is to have a discussion with them having two goals in mind - Get a clearer understanding of what they are looking to achieve and gather information on what they know about their target audience or existing customers. This helps me decide the approach and direction to take throughout the project.</p>

            <div class="expansionLayer" id="interviewOutcome">
                <h2>Client interview outcome</h2>
                <p>My interview sessions with clients are divided into two parts. The first part is focused on asking as many questions as possible about the business, customers/target audience and goals. While the second is focused on making recommendations on how we could approach the project.<br><br>At the end of the first part of the interview session I was able to establish the following.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No customer data: Woklyn has not engaged in any form of customer study or research, therefore had no data on its customers. All it has is a vague knowledge of the class of customers that patronize the business. Which fall within single and married working class persons.</li>
                    <li>Decision not backed by data: Woklyn’s decision to go digital is based on the idea that technology can help expand its reach and automate the processes that make up its service delivery system.</li>
                    <li>Established goals: The primary goal of the business, at the time, is to expand the business at little financial cost and increased customer satisfaction.</li>
                    <li>Decision not backed by data: Decisions about the type of digital product and its features were already made.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>At the end of the entire interview session, the following decisions were made as regards my approach to tackling the project.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>User research: It is crucial that user/customer research is done to gather enough information that will enable me to make the right design decisions.</li>
                    <li>Dependencies: The outcome of the research would determine our next steps.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Preparations & team briefing</h3>
            <p>I had the privilege of having two design research interns work with me on this project. To kick-off the project a briefing on the project was sent to the interns with 1 week to study and prepare for our 3 month long research adventure.</p>

            <h3>Asking the right questions</h3>
            <p>Leading the team, I facilitated brainstorming sessions based on the combination of a variant of the 10-for-10 brainstorming technique (something I learnt from AJ&Smart) and mind mapping. We had the sessions over the internet using miro and google docs to prepare the final questionnaire. <br><br>
            The goal was to come up with questions that would spark up a conversation around topics relevant to laundry and laundry service providers so we could dig deep into the minds of customers.</p>

            <h3>The analysis</h3>
            <p>After transcribing each of the 6 recordings and collating our notes, I led the team through the analysis process. The analysis method used here was Thematic analysis. <br><br>
            With the help of google docs and miro, we collaboratively and remotely pulled out striking information regarding the experiences, expectations, frustrations and motivations from the documents grouping them into themes. At the end of the analysis, we spotted 7 themes/patterns which centered around behavioral patterns and emotional response to laundry activities and laundry service providers. Out of these 7 themes we were able to make out 5 personas.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion & recommendations</h2>
            <p>"You can't build a great building on a weak foundation. You must have a solid foundation if you're going to have a strong superstructure." - Gordon B. Hinckley. <br><br>
            Judging from the insights gathered from the study - Click to view insights - we proposed a closer look and possible redesign of their existing service delivery system which forms the foundations of the business. Before going ahead to design a digital version that would serve customers in a unique and satisfying way.</p>
