            <h1>Woklyn: a decision to go digtal</h1>
            <hr>
            <h3 slot="h-1">Summary</h3>
            <p>In an attempt to go digital, the need to answer crucial business question arose. Leading a team of 3 design researchers, I embarked on a journey to understand the people who interact with the business - getting insight on their motivations, pain-points and excitements. After two and a half months of work, we ended up with a conclusion that our client needed to rethink the existing service delivery roadmap. There was a lot of distrust among customers. Redesigning the service delivery roadmap to portray professionalism and trustworthiness would be the right way to go before considering digitization.</p>

            <h2 slot="h-2">About project</h2>
            <p>Woklyn is a laundry service provider based in the city of Port Harcourt in Nigeria. The business serves a mid-sized set of customers and is looking to expand its reach.</p>
            <p>I led a small team of UX design practitioners through a 4-month-long user research phase, with the goal of gathering as much insight as possible about customers of the business - existing and prospective.</p>
            <h2 slot="h-3">Procedures</h2>
            <h3 slot="sh-3-1">Preparations & briefing</h3>
            <p>The project kicked-off with a series of interviews with the business owners to understand what they were looking to achieve - goals and bottom lines. The interviews - semi-structured - were conducted remotely and lasted 2 sessions of about 1hr 15min per session. At the end of the interview sessions I put together a brief for the team highlighting the objectives, goals and project timeline as well as tools that will be utilized throughout the project. The entire project was done remotely therefore we had to use tools like Slack, Zoom, Miro and Google docs.</p>
